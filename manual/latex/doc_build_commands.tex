\section{Build commands}\label{sec:build-commands}

The following instructions outline the steps required to build the MPM-Geomechanics project.

\subsection {Instruction commands using Linux/WSL or MSYS2 MINGW64 console line}

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and execute the following commands:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	cd build/CMake
	cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
	cmake --build build -j
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Compilation in Windows}

Prior to proceeding with these instructions, please consult the windows required programs section in this manual.

The simplest way to compile on windows is by using the `.bash` file at `/build/CMake` with `MSYS2 MINGW64` console line, just execute:

\begin{lstlisting}
	cd project-directory/build/CMake
	./cmake-build.bash
\end{lstlisting}

Alternatively, you can use the following commands:

\begin{lstlisting}
	cd project-directory/build/CMake
	cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -B build
	cmake --build build
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{ Compiling on Linux } 

Prior to proceeding please consult the Linux Required Programs section in this manual.

The simplest way to compile on Linux is by using the `.bash` file at `/build/CMake`, just execute:

\begin{lstlisting}	
	cd build/CMake
	./cmake-build.bash
\end{lstlisting}

Alternatively, you can use the following commands:

\begin{lstlisting}	
	cd build/CMake
	cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -B build
	cmake --build build
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Visual Studio Solution}\label{sec:visual-studio-solution}

For compiling the code in windows you can use the Visual Studio solution file `/build/MPM-Geomechanics.sln`, and build it by pressing `Ctr+B`.
Alternatively you can compile it by using command in a *Developer Command Prompt*: 

\begin{lstlisting}
	msbuild MPM-Geomechanics.sln -p:Configuration=Release
\end{lstlisting}

\section{ Make Compilation }\label{sec:-make-compilation-}

For compile the code in a linux environment, execute the makefile inside the make folder: \verb| MPM-Geomechanics\build\make\makefile|.
