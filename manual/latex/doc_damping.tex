\section{ Numerical damping }\label{sec:-numerical-damping-}

Real materials dissipates energy during movement. Temperature ans plastic deformation are common sources of energy dissipation. In numerical analysis numerical damping can be used for obtaining the quasi-static condition of the dynamic system.

\section{ Local damping }\label{sec:-local-damping-}

The numerical damping is a technique for getting a stationary solution of the dynamic system. In the MPM-Geomechanics simulator we have two type of numerical damping: the local (viscous) and the kinetic (dynamic relaxation) damping.
