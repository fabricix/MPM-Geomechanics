\subsection{Local damping}

Local damping is an external force acting in opposite direction of the unbalanced total nodal forces:

$$ f_{iI}^{dnplocal} = - \alpha |f_{iI}^{unb}| \hat{v}_{iI} $$

For a damping force proportional to the $14.5\%$ of unbalanced forces we need to specify the type of damping and the value of $\alpha$:

\begin{lstlisting}[language={}, caption={Defining local damping in json file.}]
	"damping":{"type"=":"local", "alpha":0.145}
\end{lstlisting}

The stress field obtained from a local damping forced system, cam be used as initial stress field value.
