The MPM-Geomechanics program is an open source implementation of the Material Point Method (MPM) for geomechanics applications. It is designed to simulate the behavior of soils and rock under various loading conditions, including static and dynamic loads.

The main features of the program are:
\begin{itemize}   
	\item three dimensional formulation
	\item dynamic formulation
	\item shared memory parallelization using OpenMP
	\item body-based (pre-defined bodies, particles-list)
	\item constitutive models for soil and rock materials
	\item softening/hardening models to represent weakness during large deformations 
	\item frictional contact algorithm using STL surfaces
	\item coupled fluid-mechanical formulation (*under development*)
	\item seismic boundary conditions
\end{itemize}
