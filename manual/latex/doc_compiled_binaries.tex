\section{Compiled binaries}\label{sec:compiled-binaries}

The recommended way to get the compiled binaries is by downloading the artifacts from the latest GitHub Actions workflow run.

\begin{itemize}
	\item go to the [Actions page](https://github.com/fabricix/MPM-Geomechanics/actions).
	\item elect the latest run of the **MSBuild** workflow for Window, or **CI** for Linux.
	\item at the bottom, you will find the available artifacts under the **Artifacts** section.
	\item download the `compiled-binaries` artifact to get the compiled code.
\end{itemize}
